A simple C# library for collision algorithms with SIMD.
Based on https://gist.github.com/mtsamis/441c16f3d6fc86566eaa2a302ed247c9, this expands the concepts to work cleanly with SIMD instructions for a number of other collision types, like Rect to Point and Rect to Circle.
This still needs a lot of improvements for it to be worth actually fully publishing, so consider this a WIP and feel free to commit improvements if you have any and see this :)
